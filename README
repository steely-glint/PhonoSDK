This is a Fork of the PhonoSDK, it aims to be faster moving than the
Tropo version. 
Specifically:
	Deleting all Flash and java applet support - which simplifies the code,
		and speeds up the download.
	Adding initial support for Openfire as an xmpp server
	Adding experimental support for asterisk as a sip/pstn gateway
	Adding modes for extra low bandwidth
Generally:
	Adding what ever features suit me and my paying customers ;-)
Longer term:
	Splitting out the native client code into their own repos.
	Dumping the out-of-date phonegap code.
	Adding different transports instead of long-poll BOSH.
	Adding some sort of support for IE.

We aim to remain compatible with the PhonoGateways for webRTC .

---- Original README follows -------


The Phono SDK provides an object-oriented JavaScript API for embedding
two-way audio and chat onto any web page. The Phono SDK is a pure
client-side solution and requires zero server-side logic on your part;
all communication is handled transparently by the Tropo Cloud.
